Developing a new javascript version
Checkout a branch whose title reflects the Jira ticket number and/or the feature to be built or updated
Make all necessary changes (build or update tests if applicable)
Run npx htmllint ${sample-file-name} for each file that was updated
Example: npx htmllint src/classBased/sezzle.js
Resolve any errors and run again. Repeat until there are no errors.
Run npm run test
Resolve any errors and run again. Repeat until there are no errors.
Add and commit changes, then push the branch to Github
Open a pull request and reach out to someone with Approver access to review and merge
Releasing a new javascript version
Once the branch is merged to master, run git checkout master and git pull origin master
Run npm run release -- --newversion=${new-version-number} such that the new version follows the convention YY.MM.v (year.month.version)
For example, if today's date is December 2020 and it is the first release this month, the version will be 20.12.0. If it is the second release this month, it would be 20.12.1
This command will automatically update package.json, check out a branch, and push the branch to Github
Open a pull request and reach out to someone with Approver access to review and merge
Update the SezzleJS Changelog with a summary of all changes
Developing a new css version
Follow the same process as for javascript

Releasing a new css version
Once the branch is merged to master, run git checkout master and git pull origin master

Run npm run release-css -- --newversion=${new-version-number} such that the new version number increments following the convention ${major rewrite}.${feature change}.${iteration}

Open a pull request and reach out to someone with Approver access to review and merge

To update an existing css, run git checkout master and git pull origin master then npm run update-css -- --updateversion=${version-number}

For example, npm run update-css -- --updateversion=2.0.1.
Developing a new modal vesion
Decide the new modal version. It should increment from the current modal version following the same convention as CSS
Create a new directory under modals called modals-<version-number>.
For example, if your version is 2.0.1 then the directory name should be modals-2.0.1
Add modal.scss and modal HTML file for each of the supported languages under the new directory. The files should be named like modal-<language-code>.html
For example, modal-en.html and modal-fr.html
To try out the modal locally you need to run this command VERSION=2.0.1 LANGUAGE=en npx webpack-dev-server and this will be accessible at http://localhost:8081/ -- Now from the command you can make out, you have to specify the version and the language. -- This runs on watch mode so any change in your respective modal-<language>.html file would refresh the page and show you how the mdoal would look like.
Run npx htmllint ${sample-file-name} for each file that was updated
Example: npx htmllint modals/modals-2.0.1/modal-en.html
Resolve any errors and run again. Repeat until there are no errors.
Releasing a new modal version
Open modals/language.json and add a new line where the key is the new modal version number, and the value is an array of supported language codes for the new modal version. If your modal version 2.0.1 supports English and French, then the new item should look like the following:

{
   ...,
   "2.0.1" : ["en", "fr"]
}
Add and commit changes, then push the branch to Github

Open a pull request and reach out to someone with Approver access to review and merge

Note: This step won't release a new version yet
Once the branch is merged to master, run git checkout master and git pull origin master
Run npm run release-modal -- --newversion=${new-version-number} such that the new version number increments following the convention ${major rewrite}.${feature change}.${iteration}

For example, npm run release-modal -- --newversion=2.0.1
This command will automatically update release_history.json and update_history.json, check out a branch, and push the branch to Github
Open a pull request and reach out to someone with Approver access to review and merge

To update an existing modal, run git checkout master and git pull origin master then npm run update-modal -- --updateversion=${version-number}

For example, npm run update-modal -- --updateversion=2.0.1.
